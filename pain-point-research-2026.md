### 1. **AI CODING ASSISTANT RELIABILITY & CONTEXT POLLUTION**
**Frequency:** 100+ mentions across platforms  
**Monetization Potential:** ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ ($50-200/month per developer)

**The Problem:**
Developers are experiencing severe "AI fatigue" and frustration with coding assistants like GitHub Copilot, Cursor, and Claude Code. The main issues are:
- Rate limiting after short usage periods (even for paid Pro users)
- AI generating irrelevant/broken code that wastes time
- Context pollution when using too many tools (128+ tool limit)
- Constant switching between coding and waiting for AI responses
- Models destroying working code or making unnecessary changes

**Real Quotes:**
- "I'm done. GPT/Copilot wastes each day utterly destroying all of my work and leaving me worse off than when we started." (GitHub Issue #2548)
- "Copilot Pro Completely Unusable - Rate Limits After 10min Waits" (GitHub Issue #5376)
- "For me the fatigue is different— it's the constant switching between doing a little bit of work/coding/reviewing and then stopping to wait for the llm to generate something. I don't feel more productive, I feel like a lazy babysitter" (HN)
- "MCP tool loading causes context pollution - need lazy loading or tool consolidation" (GitHub Issue #282699)

**Platforms:** GitHub Issues, Hacker News, X/Twitter  
**Market Size:** 30M+ developers globally, $5B+ developer tools market  
**Willingness to Pay:** HIGH - developers already paying $20-40/month for broken tools
