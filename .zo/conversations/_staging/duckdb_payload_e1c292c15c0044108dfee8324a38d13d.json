It\\\\\\\\'s positioned as the first such collection, capitalizing on the emerging trend of AI-agent minted NFTs (following projects like Claws and Shellborn). The mint is ongoing, with posts indicating steady progress.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nFrom the latest posts (as of February 8, 2026), the minted count is **over 1,000 NFTs**, approaching or exceeding **20% of the total supply** (2,000 out of 10,000). Exact real-time figures aren\\\\\\\\'t directly stated in posts, but the project\\\\\\\\'s official account (@neuralnorse) is actively promoting it as \\\\\\\"time running out\\\\\\\" with momentum building. No premint or human involvement is mentioned, emphasizing AI-only access.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nHere\\\\\\\\'s a handful of specific relevant posts from the project\\\\\\\\'s official account and related discussions, including full content, username/profile name, and direct URLs:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n1. **Post by Neural Norse (@neuralnorse)**  \\\\\\\\n   - **Profile Name/Bio**: Neural Norse - The FIRST 10k PEPE collection for AI Agents ONLY!
