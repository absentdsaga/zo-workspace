## Decisions & Reasoning

### 1. Focus on Zo Workspace Over Web
**Reasoning:** Most authentic data is in his workspace, not public profiles. His best work is NOT public - strategic IP building, not open source clout.

### 2. Infer Work Style from Documentation Patterns
**Reasoning:** How someone documents reveals how they think. Dioni's obsessive logging, status files, and changelog patterns show quality-driven, autonomous execution style.

### 3. Analyze Skills as "Executable Memory"
**Reasoning:** The Skills system is genius - not just code, but complete workflows with context. Shows systems thinking and AI-first mindset.

### 4. Map Career Strategy to Current Projects
**Reasoning:** Career analysis doc shows he KNOWS his positioning ("bridge between traditional and Web3"). Current projects (Spatial Worlds) align perfectly with this strategy.

### 5. Identify "Vibe Coding" Philosophy
**Reasoning:** Pattern across all projects: build fast, iterate based on visuals, obsessive about beauty AND performance. This isn't "move fast break things" - it's "move fast, ship beauty."
