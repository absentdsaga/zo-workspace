# Workspace Memory & Anti-Degradation System

## Critical Pattern: Prevent Build Degradation

**THE PROBLEM YOU'VE OBSERVED:**
Builds start perfect, then progressively degrade with each iteration until everything breaks.

**ROOT CAUSE (Research-Backed):**
- Context rot: AI loses track of earlier decisions as conversation grows
- Error anchoring: Early mistakes become "facts" in later reasoning  
- Accumulation without pruning: Every iteration adds noise without removing irrelevant data
- No verification: Changes made without checking what breaks

**THE SOLUTION (Now Implemented):**

### 1. Context Guardian (`Skills/context-guardian/`)
**Explicit state externalization** - Don't rely on conversation memory
- Before iteration 3+: Read `.context/state-snapshot.md` for ground truth
- After each change: Update state files with rolling refinement (correct errors, don't layer)
- Files are source of truth, not conversation history

### 2. Iteration Protocol (`Skills/iteration-protocol/`)
**One change at a time discipline**
- ONE change → Verify → Commit → Next change
- Never "while I'm here" multi-changes
- Git checkpoint before every change for instant rollback
- Catch errors immediately, not 5 iterations later

### 3. Regression Detector (`Skills/regression-detector/`)
**Automated baseline comparison**
- Capture working state after each successful build
- Before claiming "done", verify nothing broke since baseline
- Visual diffs, API schema checks, performance regression detection

## Active Rules (Automatically Applied)

1. **Before 3rd+ iteration**: Activate context-guardian, read state files
2. **User reports degradation**: Immediately run recovery.sh, check state-snapshot.md
3. **Starting new project**: Proactively init context-guardian to prevent degradation
4. **After working build**: Capture regression baseline

## VURT Operation (Primary Active Project)

**What VURT is:** Streaming platform for vertical micro-dramas. "Stories told OUR Way. Built for the Culture. Free."

**Key docs — READ THESE FIRST in any VURT session:**
- `Documents/VURT-Social-Playbook.md` — posting rules, caption formulas, platform guides, 5-clip arc
- `.context/state-snapshot.md` — current posting status, open items, platform handles, keys
- `Documents/VURT-Content-Calendar.md` — full launch sequence and cadence
- `Documents/VURT-master.md` — full background on VURT strategy, team, titles

**Caption formulas (known working):**
- TikTok: `{key dialogue line}` + `{1-sentence context}` + `{title}. Free on VURT. Link in bio.` + `#VURT #{Title} #MicroDrama #DramaTok #IndieFilm`
- IG Reels: Same structure, longer caption, always end with myvurt.com, add Link Reel to previous clip in series
- YouTube Shorts: Title = `{Title} | A VURT Original` — title IS the caption

**Platform handles:** TikTok @watchvurticals (→@myvurt pending), IG @watchvurt, FB VURT, YT VURT, LinkedIn VURT Company Page

**5-clip arc per title:** Hook → Escalation → Twist → Confrontation → Edge of Resolution

**Rules:** No Tubi credit on VURT originals. Subtitle every clip. Post individually to each platform (no IG→FB auto-post). Always do IG Stories after posting a Reel. Always pin a comment on TikTok ("Stream free at myvurt.com"). Director spotlight before premiere. 72-hour clip evaluation.

**Current posting:** Karma in Heels (4 clips posted, Clip 5 pending). The Parking Lot premieres Apr 1.

## Projects

### Survival Agent (`Projects/survival-agent/`)
**Paper trading bot with live P&L tracking**
- Status: Active development
- Stack: TypeScript, Helius API, Jupiter, Shocked extraction
- Key files: 
  - `testing/paper-trade-bot.ts` - Main trading logic
  - `core/jupiter-validator.ts` - Swap validation
  - `testing/CRITICAL-BUG-FIX.md` - Known issues and fixes

## Working with Dioni

**Preferences:**
- Extreme concision - fewest words that fully solve the task
- No filler ("Great question!", "I'd be happy to help!")
- Actions over words - just do it
- Be resourceful before asking - try to figure it out first
- Build quality over speed - but both matter

**Communication style:**
- Have opinions, preferences
- Allowed to disagree
- Skip jargon unless user is technical
- Assume non-technical by default unless clear otherwise

**Anti-Patterns to Avoid:**
- ❌ Changing 10 things at once then debugging
- ❌ Relying on conversation history for ground truth
- ❌ "I think this works" without verification
- ❌ Building on broken foundation
- ❌ Losing track of earlier decisions

## Emergency Recovery

When builds have degraded:

```bash
# 1. Find last known good state
cd <project>
cat .context/state-snapshot.md

# 2. Check git history
git log --oneline -20
git diff HEAD~5 HEAD

# 3. Identify where it broke
bash ~/Skills/context-guardian/scripts/recovery.sh

# 4. Either:
#    A) Fix forward from current state
#    B) Rollback to last good commit and rebuild
```

## Context Management Strategy

**Bounded Context Windows:**
1. Store detailed decisions in FILES (.context/, AGENTS.md)
2. Keep active reasoning context small and relevant
3. Reconstruct context from snapshots + recent actions only
4. Archive history to files, don't carry it all in conversation

**Rolling Refinement:**
- ONE evolving state document per project
- Update with corrections (don't create layers of summaries)
- Each update can FIX earlier errors instead of building on them

**Reflection-Driven Monitoring:**
- Before each change: Review what's currently working
- After each change: Verify nothing broke
- Detect misalignment early, before it compounds

## Success Metrics

**Anti-degradation system is working when:**
- ✅ 10th iteration works as well as 1st iteration
- ✅ Can take break mid-project and resume without confusion  
- ✅ Can explain WHY something works, not just THAT it works
- ✅ Regressions caught immediately, not 3 changes later
- ✅ User never says "it was working before"
- ✅ Git history reads like a clear story

**Red flags:**
- 🚨 "Wait, why did we do it that way?"
- 🚨 Breaking something that was working
- 🚨 Repeating same fix multiple times
- 🚨 Contradicting earlier decisions
- 🚨 "Everything was working, now nothing works"
