## WHAT DIONI ACTUALLY SAID (CRITICAL)

### ❌ What He DOESN'T Want:
- **NO COO roles** - doesn't want to work for someone else
- **NO "consultant" positioning** - "selling myself as one seems like bullshit" (he's done consulting work, but hates the consultant IDENTITY)
- **NO boring optimization work** - doesn't want to optimize workflows forever

### ✅ What He CAN Do:
- **Sells and closes deals regularly** - comfortable with sales when authentic
- **Builds things** - already building Spatial Worlds unprompted
- **Makes money AND has fun** - explicitly stated goal
- **Open to anything** - his words
- **Executes at scale** - proven with $750M track record

### 🎯 What He's ACTUALLY Doing Right Now:
- Building proximity voice chat multiplayer worlds
- Chrono Trigger-style pixel art
- 8-direction movement, elevation, depth sorting
- Real-time sync optimization
- Having fun vibe coding

## KEY INSIGHTS

1. **He's a builder AND a closer** - can sell when it's authentic, just hates the "consultant" label
2. **He has Oscar-level taste** - knows what's good
3. **He's technical now** - shipping multiplayer engines, not just dabbling
4. **He wants autonomy** - no jobs, no fake positioning
5. **He wants revenue without theater** - needs money, can sell, but hates inauthentic positioning

## THE REAL QUESTION

How does someone with:
- Oscar-level creative taste
- $750M proven track record  
- Technical execution skills (shipping multiplayer engines)
- Can sell and close deals regularly
- No interest in traditional employment or "consultant" positioning
- Need for revenue + fun

...make a lot of money doing what they love?

## THE KEY DISTINCTION

- ❌ "Hire me as a consultant to fix your workflow" = feels fake to him
- ✅ "I built this thing, want to buy it?" = authentic

He doesn't hate selling. He hates **selling himself as a service**.

## WHAT I NEED TO FIGURE OUT

**What can he BUILD and SELL** that:
- Leverages his creative + technical skills
- He can authentically sell (as founder/creator, not consultant)
- Makes money fast
- Is fun to build and sell
